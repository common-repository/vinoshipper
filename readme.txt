### Important Information ###
Use of this plugin connects to [Vinoshipper](https://vinoshipper.com) and requires a Vinoshipper Producer account in good standing. This allows the plugin to obtain product and store information to display to your users. This also allows users to add items to a shopping cart and initiate checkout.
